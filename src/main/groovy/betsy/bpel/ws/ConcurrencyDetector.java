 * Detects concurrency from the perspective of the partner service.
 * <p>
 * This is done by checking whether the partner service can detect multiple parallel pending requests.
 * A pending request has already sent its request to the partner service, but the caller is still waiting for the reply to arrive.
 * During this time, another request may enter the partner service.
 * If this is the case, we can be sure that the calls were done in parallel, as the caller has to wait for the response normally.
